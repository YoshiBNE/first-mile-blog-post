I used to study mechanical engineering but I have failed completing it. I wanted to stay in Australia so I found a way to stay here by appyling for sponcered visa as a cook. I finally got PR recently and realised this might a moment to start something new. I have been thinking to study web developing by myself because web developers are highly demanded in the world and also the job does not choose a place to work as well.
